On a failed save, the creature can\u0027t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can\u0027t make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save."}]}
