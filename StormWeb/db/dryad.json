Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target\u0027s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad\u0027s Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.\nThe dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time."}]}
